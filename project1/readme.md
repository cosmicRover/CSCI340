# Project 1

### instructions to run.
cd into project1 directory
run: 
    g++ time.cpp
    ./a.out <your_command>

## Challenges:

The most challenging aspect of this exercise was to find a way to get the output of the provided command onto a pipe from the child process, and extract/displaying them on the parent process. Admittedly, I had to read some supplemental materials on pipes along with going over some code examples to solidify the concepts. Once I had that figured out, it was only a matter of time before the exercise was finished.

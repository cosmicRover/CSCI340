## Challenges:

The most challenging aspect of this exercise was to understand the Red Robin Algorithm. Although it can be understood from the book alone, I had to go through a variety of online resources to understand what it is that I must do. 

In the end, I don't think I've fully understood it. Hence, the program's output may be wrong.

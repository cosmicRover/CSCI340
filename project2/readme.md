# Project 2

### instructions to run.
cd into project2 directory
run: g++ -std=c++11 threads.cpp  then  run: ./a.out

## Challenges:

The most challenging aspect of this exercise was to find a way to get the 20 threads to work peoperly after the initial 5. I had to do go through a lot of trial and errors to figure out a working solution. It still takes couple of tries sometimes to get it working though.
